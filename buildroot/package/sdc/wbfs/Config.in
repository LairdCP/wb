	  A tree of common files will be copied to the output/target rootfs, in
	  addition to the fs/skeleton files.

	  Depending on the string value of env variable WB_PLATFORM, also add a
	  matching tree <directory-name> of specific files to the rootfs.
	  And if a matching <script-name>.sh is found, will source it.
