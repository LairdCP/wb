Kernel Note for wb40n_devel target
==================================

If developing with the wb40n_devel target and a default.xml manifest, be aware that you must first checkout the master-v3.2 branch of the kernel. The *_devel targets build from the live kernel tree in wb/buildroot/package/lrd-closed-source/externals/kernel. If that Git repository was checked out with the default.xml or otherwise on the master branch, you need to be sure to switch that code to the master-v3.2 branch first.

	cd wb/buildroot/package/lrd-closed-source/externals/kernel
	git checkout -b master-v3.2 origin/master-v3.2

Note that if you've already created a local master-v3.2 branch you should check it out and update it:

	cd wb/buildroot/package/lrd-closed-source/externals/kernel
	git checkout master-v3.2
	git fetch
	git rebase origin/master-v3.2

Remember if going back to work on the wb45n_devel target to switch back to master.

This note is only for the lifetime that the WB40NBT code is on kernel version 3.2. The current plan is to unify all products across a common kernel version, so at that point, this won't be necessary any longer.
