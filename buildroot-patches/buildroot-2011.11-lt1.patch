+# No guarantees about this. I'm a novice at the details of Linux
+# networking.
+
+# Notes:
+
+# 0. This script is based on the netbsd script supplied with dhcp-970306.
+
+# 1. ifconfig down apparently deletes all relevant routes and flushes
+# the arp cache, so this doesn't need to be done explicitly.
+
+# 2. The alias address handling here has not been tested AT ALL.
+# I'm just going by the doc of modern Linux ip aliasing, which uses
+# notations like eth0:0, eth0:1, for each alias.
+
+# 3. I have to calculate the network address, and calculate the broadcast
+# address if it is not supplied. This might be much more easily done
+# by the dhclient C code, and passed on.
+
+# 4. TIMEOUT not tested. ping has a flag I don't know, and I'm suspicious
+# of the $1 in its args.

+# SECTION: Agent Operating Mode
+#
+#   This section defines how the agent will operate when it
+#   is running.
+
+# master: Should the agent operate as a master agent or not.
+#   Currently, the only supported master agent type for this token
+#   is "agentx".
+#   
+#   arguments: (on|yes|agentx|all|off|no)
+
+#master  yes
+
+# agentaddress: The IP address and port number that the agent will listen on.
+#   By default the agent listens to any and all traffic from any
+#   interface on the default SNMP port (161).  This allows you to
+#   specify which address, interface, transport type and port(s) that you
+#   want the agent to listen on.  Multiple definitions of this token
+#   are concatenated together (using ':'s).

+#   Note that setting this value here means that when trying to
+#   perform an snmp SET operation to the sysLocation.0 variable will make
+#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
+#   this token in the snmpd.conf file will disable write access to
+#   the variable.
+#   arguments:  location_string

+#   the agent return the "notWritable" error code.  IE, including
