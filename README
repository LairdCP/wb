PACKAGES REQUIRED
=================
The build system requires various packages installed on the development host.
Because there are so many distros out there we cannot know what you distro
calls the required packages and how they are organised. However, we can tell
you that on the standard installation of Ubuntu or Linux Mint:
bison
flex
msgfmt
makeinfo
patch
rsync
c++
python-m2crypto

HOW TO BUILD
============
cd to the top level directory and type:
make

ANATOMY
=======
The top level directory contains the folowing directories:
* buildroot
    this is where buildroot resides
* archive
    this is where buildroot packages reside
* buildroot-patches
    we store patches that alter the default behaviour of buildroot here
* images
    this is where the final built images are copied to

HOW WE EXTEND BUILDROOT
=======================
We extend buildroot by adding new boards (wb40n, wb40n) and new packages.
The boards reside in the directories: buildroot/boards/sdc/wb4?n.
The packages reside inside: buildroot/package/sdc
